# SharePoint Online Tenant-Wide Security Audit

## Overview

The **SharePoint Online Tenant-Wide Security Audit** tool performs a comprehensive security assessment across a Microsoft 365 tenant. It identifies misconfigurations, excessive permissions, external sharing risks, and governance gaps to help organizations strengthen their SharePoint security posture.

This solution provides actionable findings, structured reporting, and remediation guidance to improve visibility and reduce exposure across sites, users, and administrative roles.
